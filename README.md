# SEDA Data Merge

This repository contains R code for processing and analyzing two datasets: `dataset 1` which includes daily maximum temperature and daily minimum relative humidity records by zipcode, and `dataset 2` which includes school information by zipcode.


## Requirements
To run the provided code, you need:
- R programming environment
- Required packages: `dplyr`, `tidyr`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `install.packages("dplyr")` and `install.packages("tidyr")` in your R console.
3. Adjust file paths and names according to your data locations.
4. Run the R scripts as described in the [Data Processing](#data-processing) section.

## Data Processing
### SEDA Data
The `seda_data_filtered` DataFrame is generated by reading `seda_crosswalk_4.1.csv` which contains school-related information. It is filtered to retain only school name, school ID, year, and zipcode columns.

Result: 

| sedaschname                       | ncessch       | sedasch      | year | lzip |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|--------------|------|------|
| Albertville Middle School         | 10000500870   | 10000500870  | 2013 | 35950|
| Evans Elementary School           | 10000500879   | 10000500879  | 2013 | 35950|
| Albertville Elementary School     | 10000500889   | 10000500889  | 2013 | 35950|
| Kate Duncan Smith DAR Middle      | 10000600193   | 10000600193  | 2013 | 35747|

### Max Air Temperature
Yearly maximum air temperature data is processed for years 2009 to 2018. Each year's data is loaded, converted to tidy format, and saved as `.RData` files.

Result: 
| zipcode | date       | max_air_temperature |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| 01001   | 2016-01-01 | 277.3618            |
| 01001   | 2016-01-02 | 276.7532            |
| 01001   | 2016-01-03 | 278.6746            |


### Minimum Relative Humidity
Yearly minimum relative humidity data is processed for years 2009 to 2018. Each year's data is loaded, converted to tidy format, and saved as `.RData` files.

Result: 
| zipcode | date       | min_relative_humidity |
|---------|------------|-----------------------|
| 01001   | 2010-01-01 | 61.29655              |
| 01001   | 2010-01-02 | 58.00437              |
| 01001   | 2010-01-03 | 52.80716              |
